Animation:

There are two types of animation.
    1. Explicit Animations
        - Give us more control(Using animation controller), But more complex to create.
        - If the animation repeats over and over without stoping or requires granular control we would use an explicit animation with   an animation controller.
        
    2. Implicit Animations
        - Give us less controll, but are easier to create using either custom or built-in animated widgets.
